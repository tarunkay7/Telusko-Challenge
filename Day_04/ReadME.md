# Spring MVC

Today I learnt about Spring API with Spring API, you can create all sorts of web applications, whether it's a simple website or a complex system with lots of functionalities. It's widely used because it's reliable, flexible, and has a huge community of developers supporting it.

One of the best things about Spring API is that it follows the "dependency injection" principle. That might sound fancy, but basically, it means that it helps you manage your code in a way that makes it easier to understand and maintain. You can create different components, or "beans," that work together and can be easily connected to each other.

Another cool feature of Spring API is its support for different modules, like Spring MVC and Spring Boot. Spring MVC helps you build web applications by providing tools for handling requests and responses. Meanwhile, Spring Boot is like a turbocharger for Spring, making it super easy to set up and run your applications with minimal configuration.

Oh, and did I mention that Spring API has great support for databases? You can connect your application to a database easily and perform operations like saving, updating, and retrieving data. It makes working with databases a breeze

Now to show you about my implementation of the spring framework I have created a repositor for it which i will be linking below. Do check it out
